In this Repo you will get to see the code for my Internship Project Titled: MICROWAVE OVEN SIMULATION

During my Internship journey provided by EMERTXE University, I learnt How to use MPLAB x IDE and PICSimLab Simulator,
In this project I have written codes in Embedded C for interfacing of various pheripherals of PIC16F877A Microcontroller.
