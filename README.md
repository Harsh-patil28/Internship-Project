# Internship-Project
In this Repo you will get to see the code for my Internship Project Titled:<head>MICROWAVE OVEN SIMULATION</head> 
<br>
During my Internship journey provided by EMERTXE University, I learnt How to use MPLAB x IDE and PICSimLab Simulator, In this project I have written codes in Embedded C for interfacing of various pheripherals of PIC16F877A Microcontroller. 
<br>
In this project I have simulated a Microwave Oven, which consist of 4 modes namely
<ol>
  <li>Micro mode</li>
  <li>Grill mode</li>
  <li>Convection mode</li>
  <li>Start mode</li>
</ol>
